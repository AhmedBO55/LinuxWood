Today I focused on improving the CAD model after learning a lot from the first prototype.
I found several design issues during assembly, so I fixed them and added new features, including a custom screen holder for better stability and alignment.

I couldn’t go to the fablab this time because of my busy high school schedule, so I haven’t laser cut or assembled the new version yet.
Still, the CAD work is progressing well, and the next prototype should be more precise and easier to build.
