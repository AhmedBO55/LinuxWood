After finishing the 3D model of V2 in the last devpost, I finally had time after my exams to go to the fablab and laser cut the pieces.
I assembled the V2 model, but during the process I faced several problems with alignment and fitting, and I even broke some parts.
These issues helped me understand what needed to be improved, so I decided to rebuild everything from zero and create V3.

For V3, I redesigned the CAD model with better measurements and stronger connections, then did another laser cut and assembly.
This version turned out almost perfect, with all the components fitting correctly and a more stable structure.

I also fixed a long-time problem with the charging port. It used to be unstable, so I removed the jack connectors and soldered the charger directly to the motherboard for a strong and reliable connection.

Now the project is almost complete and fully functional. The only thing left is to add the final support stand to finish the workstation.
