## 10/11/2025 - Day 1 ‚Äî Giving New Life to the Laptop

Today I started the LinuxWood project by disassembling the old laptop, cleaning every component carefully, and replacing the HDD with an SSD.

Then I created a bootable Xubuntu USB using BalenaEtcher and installed the system successfully.
It‚Äôs my first time installing Linux, and seeing Xubuntu run smoothly on old hardware felt amazing!

Now the laptop is ready for the next steps ‚Äî designing the new body and planning the flexible stand.  

## 10/12/2025 - First Prototype and Laser Cut Assembly  

I designed the 3D CAD model of the new laptop body in Fusion 360 and brought it to life at the fablab using 5 mm MDF on the laser cutter.
After cutting all the parts, I assembled the monitor and motherboard inside ‚Äî the first prototype worked great for understanding dimensions and structure!

I also customized Xubuntu by installing a new theme and backgrounds, making the setup look more modern.
Finally, I uploaded the DXF files to GitHub so anyone can download, modify, or build their own version.

This was a big step toward making LinuxWood a real, working workstation!
