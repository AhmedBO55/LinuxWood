## 10/11/2025 - Day 1 ‚Äî Giving New Life to the Laptop  

üõ†Ô∏è![ph1.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTUzNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--43a9c6c2c1a443b575fb8c7171ac7cf08430899f/ph1.jpg)

Today I started the LinuxWood project by disassembling the old laptop, cleaning every component carefully, and replacing the HDD with an SSD.

Then I created a bootable Xubuntu USB using BalenaEtcher and installed the system successfully.
It‚Äôs my first time installing Linux, and seeing Xubuntu run smoothly on old hardware felt amazing!

Now the laptop is ready for the next steps ‚Äî designing the new body and planning the flexible stand.  

## 10/12/2025 - First Prototype and Laser Cut Assembly  

I designed the 3D CAD model of the new laptop body in Fusion 360 and brought it to life at the fablab using 5 mm MDF on the laser cutter.
After cutting all the parts, I assembled the monitor and motherboard inside ‚Äî the first prototype worked great for understanding dimensions and structure!

I also customized Xubuntu by installing a new theme and backgrounds, making the setup look more modern.
Finally, I uploaded the DXF files to GitHub so anyone can download, modify, or build their own version.

This was a big step toward making LinuxWood a real, working workstation!

## 10/13/2025 - Improved CAD Model and New Screen Holder  

Today I focused on improving the CAD model after learning a lot from the first prototype.
I found several design issues during assembly, so I fixed them and added new features, including a custom screen holder for better stability and alignment.

I couldn‚Äôt go to the fablab this time because of my busy high school schedule, so I haven‚Äôt laser cut or assembled the new version yet.
Still, the CAD work is progressing well, and the next prototype should be more precise and easier to build.![{226F43C5-9046-47A3-8302-0E2EF6F4A202}.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjA1MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ce58a38876c1b643dd62485b70f261ea3dae20d7/%7B226F43C5-9046-47A3-8302-0E2EF6F4A202%7D.png)

## 10/28/2025 - Building the V3 Model and Final Fixes  

After finishing the 3D model of V2 in the last devpost, I finally had time after my exams to go to the fablab and laser cut the pieces.
I assembled the V2 model, but during the process I faced several problems with alignment and fitting, and I even broke some parts.
These issues helped me understand what needed to be improved, so I decided to rebuild everything from zero and create V3.

For V3, I redesigned the CAD model with better measurements and stronger connections, then did another laser cut and assembly.
This version turned out almost perfect, with all the components fitting correctly and a more stable structure.

I also fixed a long-time problem with the charging port. It used to be unstable, so I removed the jack connectors and soldered the charger directly to the motherboard for a strong and reliable connection.

Now the project is almost complete and fully functional. The only thing left is to add the final support stand to finish the workstation.![1](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjI1MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3cd47c70b55294e135c8113ece8d47e66ba832ea/1.jpg)
