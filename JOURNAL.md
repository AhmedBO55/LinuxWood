Today I started the LinuxWood project by disassembling the old laptop, cleaning every component carefully, and replacing the HDD with an SSD.

Then I created a bootable Xubuntu USB using BalenaEtcher and installed the system successfully.
It‚Äôs my first time installing Linux, and seeing Xubuntu run smoothly on old hardware felt amazing!

Now the laptop is ready for the next steps ‚Äî designing the new body and planning the flexible stand.
